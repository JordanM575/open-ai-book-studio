/*
 * Host-owned cancellable voice transport (017 T016, D-200 / ADR 0021 item 6).
 *
 * This is the pure accounting/identity half of STT and TTS dispatch. It owns monotonic operation and
 * chunk IDs, the exact session/route/permission check performed immediately before every send, the
 * one-outstanding-operation-per-kind backpressure rule and an honest settlement record. It performs
 * no request, holds no audio/text and returns descriptions only; the trusted host executes them.
 *
 * Charge honesty (D-116/D-192): a dispatched request that the provider did not price stays
 * `unknown`. A never-dispatched request is `unsent`, which is a local fact and not a provider
 * claim. Reported amounts are added into `reportedUsd`; unknown chunks are counted separately so a
 * caller can never read an unreported request as a fabricated zero.
