# Plan: agent interaction and guidance

**Spec:** [spec.md](spec.md) · **Tasks:** [tasks.md](tasks.md)
**Status:** In progress — T004/T010 and W03 Discuss/Edit permissions, composer and bounded
request guidance implemented. Plan lifecycle and integrated delivery acceptance remain open.
See [candidate evidence and delivery runbook](implementation.md).

## Shape

Extend the existing author-to-agent interaction without creating a second runtime or writer. A turn's
mode, bounded guidance and any plan lifecycle state travel through the studio-owned message/thread
contract. The main-process runtime enforces the mode and controls each plan transition; the shared
composer presents author-visible state. All manuscript changes continue through the 024 tool catalog
and checked Library writer.

## Public boundaries

- **002** owns the agent's editing tools, destructive approvals, conflict handling, turn checkpoints,
  stop behavior and one-turn undo. Plan start is not an approval for any individual destructive tool.
- **011** owns the book default, one-turn model override and the model/provider/connection actually
  recorded on a turn. The new composer must reuse its control rather than add another chooser.
- **017** owns explicit per-turn background behavior. A plan cannot enable background work; any
  continuation is explicit and linked to the same plan, and a full app-process restart expires an
  unfinished plan.
- **024** owns tool definitions, schemas and safety tiers. Discuss filtering must use those existing
  definitions and must not add a second tool dialect or weaken toolkit permissions.
- **025** owns `SKILLS.md`, tool settings and plugins. Current plugins do not declare read-only
  capability, so the proposed Discuss implementation excludes them unless a public decision and
  contract change says otherwise.

## Runtime and persistence

- T004 already extends `AgentTurnInput` with mode and bounded guidance. Finish validating/enforcing
  them at the runtime boundary. Keep the mode attached to the submitted/stored turn so reloads cannot infer a
  different permission level from the current composer.
- Add studio-owned plan data and events to the thread/message contract, not AI SDK UI-message types.
  Validate plan identity, bounded step text and state transitions. Store plans with their originating
  request and thread through `ThreadStore`; any explicit runtime continuation remains linked to that
  same plan. Do not add a hidden database or a second job queue.
- Apply Discuss filtering when the runtime constructs its available tools, and reject a denied tool
  at execution time as well. The renderer's mode toggle is presentation, not the security boundary.
- A plan begins in `proposed`; the runtime waits for the author to start it before exposing any
  write-capable tool. The plan state is a progress record, not authority. Existing approval requests
  remain the only way to authorize destructive actions.
- Cancel stops the runtime work linked to that plan. Do not roll back successful writes
  automatically; report partial work and rely on the existing checkpoint/undo contract. On runtime
  loss, make the stored state non-resumable and visibly expired.
- Reuse the existing book-level agent settings for tone (bounded to 500 characters) and answer
  length (Brief, Standard, Detailed). Keep optional one-turn guidance with its submitted message,
  bounded to 2,000 characters without silent truncation. Reuse 025's existing `SKILLS.md` path rather
  than creating a duplicate persistent instruction store.
- Any thread/book schema changes require corresponding `docs/FORMAT.md` documentation before
  implementation writes them. Preserve older threads by displaying their mode as unrecorded rather
  than guessing.

## Accepted decisions and remaining sequence

D-177–D-179 are accepted in `docs/DECISIONS.md`. Reuse their decisions rather than reopening them as
missing research. Their matching demo/script/runbook delivery condition still applies.

1. Deliver the mode portion of T006 with T007–T009: default Discuss, the exact six read-tier tools,
   bridge denial and excluded plugins. Do not expose the toggle ahead of enforcement. Verify ordinary
   Edit writes, destructive approvals and undo with a scripted model and byte-checked fixtures.
2. Finish T011 request wiring for existing book preferences and one-turn guidance. Assert the exact
   prompt scope and unchanged tool/model authority; T010's controls alone do not prove this.
3. Define T005's bounded plan states and allowed transitions before T012–T018 controls. Pause confirms
   only at terminal `stopped`; continuation is a new explicit turn with fresh approvals. Persist
   actual partial outcomes and expire plans on runtime loss; never auto-resume.
4. Complete T019–T021 accessibility, end-to-end synthetic journeys and exact-candidate evidence,
   including the matching feature description and film/runbook update.

D-179 excludes live steering. New guidance for running/paused work travels by stop plus a new turn;
it does not authorize a guidance queue, a scheduler or a larger autonomy scope under 037.

## Likely implementation surfaces

These are future implementation touchpoints, not files changed by this specification task:

- `packages/core/src/agent.ts` — validated turn input and lifecycle events.
- `packages/core/src/agent/messages.ts` and `packages/core/src/agent/threads.ts` — stored mode,
  guidance and plan parts with bounded schemas and atomic thread persistence.
- `packages/core/src/agent/settings.ts` and the book schema — per-book tone and answer-length values.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/agent/runtime.ts` and `tool-set.ts` — permission filtering, plan transitions,
  safe cancellation and expiry; no direct writes outside registered tools.
- `packages/app/src/components/ChatPanel.tsx` and its chat-view adapter — mode, guidance, plan states,
  explicit controls and clear partial-work outcomes.
- `docs/FORMAT.md` — the public ordinary-file contract for any new thread or book fields.
- Core/runtime/component tests using temporary synthetic books and a scripted model factory; no live
  provider or real manuscript is needed.

## Verification approach

Test the author-visible contract at boundaries: mode filtering in the runtime, rejected attempts to
invoke a write in Discuss, no writes before plan start, real plan-state transitions from scripted
events, approval pauses that remain approval-gated, cancellation with partial writes, expiry after a
simulated runtime restart, and guidance scope across consecutive turns. Add component tests for
keyboard access and state announcements. Use only temporary synthetic libraries, fixture chapters
and mock provider responses. Do not use live credentials, paid services, real books or devices.
