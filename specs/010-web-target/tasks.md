# Tasks: browser storage and portability

**Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md) · **Plan**: [plan.md](plan.md)

Tasks are ordered. `[P]` means safe to do in parallel with another `[P]` task in the same phase. Tests are required at the storage, archive and privacy boundaries. Cross-spec integration tasks reference specs 011, 013 and 014 rather than duplicating their ownership.

## Phase 1 — Checked library port (blocks browser storage)

- [x] T001 Define validated `LibraryPath` construction/serialization, `LibraryPort`, `FileSnapshot`, `CommitResult`, and typed adapter errors in `packages/core/src/library/path.ts`, `port.ts` and `errors.ts`.
- [x] T002 Add an in-memory `LibraryPort` with deterministic identity/time/hash injection in `packages/core/tests/support/in-memory-port.ts`.
- [x] T003 Extract shared library operations, schema checks, path policy, catalog rebuild, chapter save/conflict handling and trash policy into `packages/core/src/library/service.ts`, `packages/core/src/library/paths.ts` and `packages/core/src/library/port.ts`; import no Node or DOM APIs.
- [x] T004 Implement the Electron `LibraryPort` using the existing atomic writer in `apps/desktop/src/main/library/fs-port.ts`; keep all desktop file access in the main process.
- [x] T005 Route `apps/desktop/src/main/studio.ts` and `apps/desktop/src/main/ipc.ts` through the shared service without changing the `Result` envelope, Zod validation or renderer contract.
- [x] T006 Add port conformance tests for format round-trips, same-content no-op saves, stale version/hash conflicts, external edit conflicts, trash/restore, schema rejection, path traversal and injected write failure in `packages/core/tests/library-service.test.ts` against the in-memory port, plus the unchanged filesystem suite in `apps/desktop/tests/library.test.ts`.
- [x] T007 Re-run existing filesystem tests and hidden smoke; prove a failed write preserves the previous file and that the smoke fixture never opens the author's profile in `apps/desktop/tests/` and `apps/desktop/src/main/smoke.ts`.

## Phase 2 — Browser storage tiers (User Story 1)

- [x] T008 Define browser storage selection and `StorageSummary` types in `packages/core/src/library/storage-summary.ts`; expose no directory handles or host paths to shared UI.
- [x] T009 Implement the user-selected-folder adapter in `apps/web/src/storage/fsa.ts` and `directory-port.ts`; require a secure context and user gesture, persist only the directory handle, re-request permission on reopen, and report permission loss without switching tiers.
- [x] T010 Implement IndexedDB storage for browser library metadata/handles and an OPFS adapter with the ordinary library directory layout in `apps/web/src/storage/indexeddb.ts` and `apps/web/src/storage/opfs.ts`.
- [x] T011 Implement capability detection and cross-tab lock handling in `apps/web/src/storage/capabilities.ts` and the `webLock` wrapper in `directory-port.ts`; use feature detection, retain version/hash checks, and report when locking is unavailable.
- [x] T012 Request origin-storage persistence where supported and report granted/not-granted/not-supported plus quota failures in `apps/web/src/storage/opfs.ts`; the summary warning is shared from `packages/core/src/library/storage.ts`.
- [ ] T013 Add isolated real-browser adapter tests for picker cancellation, permission re-grant/revocation, OPFS restart, persistence denial, quota exhaustion, two tabs and no silent tier switch in `apps/web/tests/storage/`. Unit tests with fake handles now cover commit expectations, moves, device identity, picker cancellation, permission mapping, save failures, draft buffering, capability detection, persistence denial/unsupported/error paths and the cross-tab Web Lock request/fallback. `apps/web/check/` is a real-browser OPFS/conflict/archive/folder-mode harness; Playwright Chromium passes 16/16, including picker cancellation, a denied folder permission that keeps the pending folder, two-tab Web Lock serialization and an OPFS page-restart check, while Firefox/WebKit OPFS openings are recorded findings. The native folder picker and real Safari/Firefox remain.

## Phase 3 — Honest save and recovery (User Story 2)

- [x] T014 Expose browser save lifecycle results through the existing `SaveChapterResult` and storage summary contracts in `packages/core/src/ipc.ts`, without creating a second save-status enum. `LibraryInfo.storage` now carries the existing `StorageSummary`; confirmed saves update `lastCommittedAt`, and Settings shows the tier, last confirmed save, permission and browser warning. The web smoke run asserts the contract.
- [x] T015 Ensure browser writes commit complete files only; re-check current bytes/hash before commit and return a conflict result when the expected base differs. `DirectoryHandleLibraryPort` in `apps/web/src/storage/directory-port.ts` serves both the folder and OPFS tiers: it writes through the swap file, re-reads the target immediately before `close()`, aborts on a concurrent change, and verifies the read-back hash so a mismatch is `changed`, never `written`.
- [x] T016 Add injected permission, read-only, quota, interrupted-write and external-edit tests; assert old bytes remain intact and user text is not silently discarded. `apps/web/tests/storage/save-failures.test.ts` uses a shared fake handle with failure and after-write hooks; it covers stale bases, a concurrent edit during the swap, a concurrent create, permission loss, read-only folders, quota exhaustion, an interrupted close, a read-back mismatch, and a service-level save conflict that keeps both texts.
- [x] T017 Add best-effort page-hide flushing and an explicit “not confirmed saved” state contract in `apps/web/src/storage/drafts.ts`; test that an aborted flush never reports success. `BrowserDraftBuffer` reports `confirmed` / `conflict` / `unconfirmed` / `empty`, keeps a failed draft, holds text typed during a save, and drives the page-hide listener. Surfacing the state in the interface rides on T014.

## Phase 4 — Portable archive (User Story 3)

- [x] T018 Add `fflate` as a direct dependency of `packages/core` and define `ArchiveManifestV1` plus path/size validators in `packages/core/src/archive/manifest.ts`.
- [x] T019 Implement streaming library export in `packages/core/src/archive/export.ts`; preserve exact source bytes and unknown files, include author-owned conflicts/trash, and omit catalog/device/lock/temp files and credentials.
- [x] T020 Implement streaming archive preflight/import in `packages/core/src/archive/import.ts`; reject unsafe/duplicate paths, symlinks, unsupported format/schema versions, over-limit entries/bytes, insufficient capacity and hash mismatches before publishing.
- [x] T021 Implement new/empty-destination import and safe cleanup using the shared library service in `packages/core/src/archive/import-library.ts`; never merge or overwrite an existing library.
- [x] T022 Expose desktop archive export/import through validated main-process IPC in `packages/core/src/ipc.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/main/ipc.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/main/library/archive.ts`, the preload bridge and the library view actions.
- [x] T023 Add browser archive file picker/download adapters in `apps/web/src/storage/archive-io.ts`; it streams to a save picker when available and otherwise downloads a Blob, never a server request.
- [x] T024 Add archive tests for exact byte/ID round-trips, unknown files, credential exclusion, traversal, duplicate paths, symlinks, malformed manifest, bad hash, future versions, size limits, low quota and failed-write cleanup in `packages/core/tests/archive.test.ts` and `apps/desktop/tests/archive-io.test.ts`; browser archive I/O tests remain with T023.

## Phase 5 — Cross-target integration and verification (User Story 4)

- [x] T025 Update spec 011 web tasks to consume the accepted D-105 vault decision and the storage abstractions; keep OAuth/provider access gated by D-101 and do not add a proxy in `specs/011-model-access/tasks.md`. The Phase 8 tasks now record that the storage boundary and web shell landed; T037/T038 are implementation work and T039 remains blocked on D-101.
- [x] T026 Add browser end-to-end journeys for folder mode, origin-storage mode, save conflict, archive transfer and permission recovery. `scripts/web-smoke.mjs` covers origin storage, create, save, reopen, build metadata, a stale-save conflict and a portable archive export; `fsa.test.ts` covers picker cancellation and permission mapping; `archive-picker.test.ts` covers archive import selection/cancel; `folder-mode.test.ts` opens a picked fake folder, creates a book/chapter and saves; `permission-recovery.test.ts` covers a re-granted folder and a denied re-grant that keeps the pending folder. The real-browser folder-picker matrix remains T013/T027.
  Hardened: the UI typing journey now proves the keystrokes landed in the editor and the
  save committed a newer chapter version via the bridge, instead of trusting a bare
  "Saved" status that also shows when nothing changed. A no-op save returns "saved"
  without a version bump (`LibraryService.saveChapter`), so the version check is what
  distinguishes a real commit. Verified 18/18 across three consecutive runs.
- [ ] T027 Run the full Playwright/Node browser matrix plus `bun run typecheck`, `bun test`, `bun run build`, `bun run smoke` and packaged desktop smoke; the current Chromium results are recorded in `docs/research/browser-storage-matrix.md`. `scripts/browser-matrix.mjs` automates the real OPFS/conflict/archive/IndexedDB/folder-mode harness with picker-cancellation, denied-permission, two-tab lock and OPFS page-restart checks: Chromium passes 16/16; Firefox and WebKit OPFS openings fail in the Playwright builds and are recorded as findings; the app fails fast with a folder/archive recovery message. `bun run smoke:packaged` builds the unpacked app and runs the hidden suite against it: 16/16. Real Safari/Firefox and the folder-picker matrix remain.
- [x] T028 Update `docs/FORMAT.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `specs/README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and specs 011/013/014 links to match the delivered storage/archive behavior. The browser-storage commit contract, save-failure tests, web smoke journeys and spec 011 Phase 8 status are now documented.

## Dependencies and delivery

- Phase 1 blocks Phases 2–5: no browser adapter may duplicate the desktop library policy.
- Phase 4 archive service can be developed after the port contract and tested against the in-memory adapter.
- Spec 011 owns provider OAuth, browser credential UI and provider-specific direct access; spec 010 supplies the accepted storage policy and browser capability boundaries.
- Spec 013 owns shared UI extraction, `apps/web` entry, Vite/static output, build metadata and deployment. Its web shell consumes the adapters produced here.
- Spec 014 owns Capacitor native setup, safe areas, orientation, native iOS storage, protected credentials, lifecycle, permissions and capability/refusal integration; it consumes the shared port/capability contracts and the real renderer from spec 013. Native decisions and target evidence remain separate.

## MVP scope

Complete Phases 1–3 first, then archive import/export in Phase 4. Browser-provider and UI end-to-end acceptance is not complete until the dependent spec 011 and spec 013 tasks pass.
