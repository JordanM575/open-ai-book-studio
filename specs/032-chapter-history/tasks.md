# Tasks: chapter history

**Spec:** [spec.md](spec.md) · **Plan:** [plan.md](plan.md)

Tasks are ordered. `[P]` means safe to do in parallel within a phase. Storage and retention decisions
are accepted; T002 records decision completion only. W01 completes T001/T003/T004's format and
saved-only library core. W02 adds bounded T007–T009 core evidence below; IPC/UI, live draft/save
integration, cleanup and end-to-end acceptance remain open.

## Phase 0 — Resolve only the decisions needed by each task

- [x] T001 Resolve **OQ-001**: compare storage layouts and schemas for author-owned snapshot bodies,
  provenance, safety copies, and restore-undo records; decide how the data participates in the
  existing archive and chapter trash/restore lifecycle. Record a public decision (and ADR/format
  changes where needed) before starting dependent persistence work. This task does not authorize
  editing those documents as part of spec authoring.
  Accepted 2026-11-03 in D-175: `research/storage-layouts.md` pins the
  book/chapter/conflict/trash/archive facts against six alternatives:
  book-scoped `books/<bookId>/history/<chapterId>/` records mirroring chapter files (front
  matter plus body, loose schemas, newer-schema refusal), riding archive and whole-book trash
  by construction, staying keyed by stable id across chapter trash, with author deletion to
  chapter trash. Completed 2026-11-07: ADR 0016 and `docs/FORMAT.md#chapter-history` record
  the field/label/source/read/failure contracts as accepted under delegated authority before
  dependent implementation. No global decision status was changed.
- [x] T002 [P] Research and resolve **OQ-002**: decide retention, size-limit, and cleanup behavior,
  including restore-undo dependencies and safe recovery. Do not choose an age/count period by
  assumption. This decision blocks only T011; it is not a prerequisite for core snapshot and
  restore work.
  Accepted 2026-11-03 in D-176: `research/retention.md` pins unbounded
  trash/conflicts, failure preservation, and transport-only caps against auto-prune, count,
  age, and quota alternatives: no automatic pruning with trash-based
  explicit deletion and stat-based size visibility. T011's implementation remains open.

## Phase 1 — Shared snapshot contract

- [x] T003 **After T001's format/ADR work under D-175.** Define validated history record and operation types in the
  existing shared library service. Bind each record to book ID, chapter ID, source version, raw
  chapter-file hash, body hash, label, and capture time. Keep bodies and metadata in the decided
  author-owned format; reject wrong identity, unsupported schema, and corrupt bodies without
  rewriting them. Add synthetic tests through the in-memory library port.
  Completed 2026-11-07: `packages/core/src/library/history.ts` validates snapshot/safety/intent
  metadata and strict operation inputs, preserves unknown fields including nested references/results,
  and rejects malformed, foreign, future-schema and corrupt-body records without rewriting.
- [x] T004 **After T003.** Implement explicit snapshot creation and chapter-scoped list,
  open, and compare operations using only the existing checked library service/port. Verify
  creation requires a confirmed saved source and that list/open/compare do not mutate chapter
  bytes or flush drafts. Cover duplicate labels and malformed/missing records with synthetic
  fixtures.
  Completed 2026-11-07: `history-store.ts` plus the shared/desktop Library hooks capture an exact
  confirmed saved version/hash through absent-only atomic commits; list/read/compare are read-only.
  Synthetic evidence includes duplicate labels, source changes during capture, persisted identity,
  missing/unavailable records, storage failures, unverified commit responses, and real DraftBuffer
  retention beside desktop filesystem reads. The host's live save-state gate is part of T005/T006;
  the core accepts no draft text and has no flush capability.

## Phase 2 — API and author-facing history

- [ ] T005 Expose history operations through the existing validated IPC/shared-runtime boundary.
  Keep filesystem access out of the renderer and use the shared library service for desktop and
  browser targets. Add contract tests for invalid IDs, labels, and request/result errors.
- [ ] T006 Add a chapter history entry point and read-only list/open/compare UI using existing
  shared components and token conventions. Show labels, capture times, source versions, corrupt or
  unavailable states, and whether a comparison excludes an unsaved editor draft. Test author-visible
  outcomes and keyboard/focus behavior with synthetic chapters.
  Partial W02 UI delivery (2026-11-07): `packages/app/src/components/chapter-history/` provides an
  isolated injected-API dialog for saved-only capture/list/open/compare, literal bodies and changed-span
  comparison, stat sizes, individual issues, source/draft disclosure, focus/selection and asynchronous
  lifetime guards. See its README for the exact host contract. The entry point, real host draft gate,
  IPC/preload/browser adapters and light/dark/reduced-transparency visual acceptance remain parent
  integration work; T006 stays unchecked. No restore/undo or deletion action is exposed.

## Phase 3 — Checked restore and its undo

- [ ] T007 **After snapshot storage under D-175.** Implement restore preflight and confirmation: require explicit
  resolution of pending drafts, show the saved current body and selected snapshot, and retain the
  current saved body as a visible safety snapshot before writing. If safety-snapshot creation
  fails, prove that the chapter remains unchanged.
  W02 partial core evidence: strict saved-source/selected-reference requests; exact current version
  and raw hash checks; verified visible safety snapshot and prepared intent before chapter writing.
  Host draft/save gating and author confirmation are not implemented, so this task remains open.
- [ ] T008 **After T007.** Restore only the snapshot body with the current read's
  `baseVersion` and `baseHash` through the existing checked chapter writer. Preserve metadata and
  normal conflict behavior. Test stale/external changes, cancellation before and after the safety
  snapshot, write failure, delayed result, and draft preservation with the in-memory writer and
  isolated synthetic libraries.
  W02 partial core evidence: shared unlocked journal-aware checked writer under the existing book
  queue; raw current metadata preserved, including unknown runtime-name fields; exact checks even
  for equal bodies; cancellation/failure and competing-writer tests. Desktop synthetic DraftBuffer
  test retains racing text for normal conflict handling; live host coordination remains open.
- [ ] T009 **Required with T008 before exposing restore.** Persist a restore-specific undo tied to the exact committed
  post-restore version/hash. Persist a prepared intent before chapter commit and reconcile it after
  interrupted finalization; undo through the same checked writer, refuse a stale undo, and retain
  all snapshot material. Test success, reload, interrupted finalization, stale base, second writer,
  and recovery of both versions using synthetic fixtures.
  W02 partial core evidence: exact precomputed/final result identities, expected-hash intent updates,
  reload-stable undo and read-only conservative reconciliation with no replay. Legacy prepared
  intents without exact identities cannot enable undo; interrupted undo plans require review.
  Author-facing recovery, validated IPC and complete integrated acceptance remain open.
- [ ] T010 Add explicit success, stale, canceled, and failed states to the restore UI. A confirmed
  commit may update a clean editor only as an identified restore result; a racing draft remains
  visible and is not flushed or replaced. The interface must not report a commit as canceled or
  blindly retry an uncertain result.

## Phase 4 — Retention, lifecycle, and integration

- [ ] T011 **Under accepted D-176.** Implement the accepted snapshot size/retention/cleanup
  behavior. Preserve required restore-undo data, make any destructive cleanup author-visible and
  recoverable, and test policy boundaries with synthetic snapshots. No automatic pruning, quota,
  expiry or compaction is authorized; include unapplied intents in preservation tests.
- [ ] T012 **Under accepted D-175, after storage exists.** Verify the selected snapshot layout follows chapter identity
  through rename/reorder and follows existing trash/restore behavior; verify portable archive
  export/import preserves history records and hashes without making archive import a chapter
  history action. Update format/archive documentation only as required by the accepted decision.
  W01 core evidence: actual snapshot round-trips through live-book archive, whole-book trash/archive/
  restore, chapter trash/restore, title/filename/order changes; future/unknown-field history bytes
  survive transport. Remains open for the complete safety/intent/restore journey delivered by W02.
- [ ] T013 [P] Cover storage-full, permission-loss, corrupt record, wrong identity, cancellation,
  interrupted response, and stale restore/undo paths at library boundaries. Use only the existing
  checked library writer, synthetic fixtures, the in-memory port, and isolated temporary
  libraries; never use real manuscripts, credentials, live providers, paid services, or devices.

## Phase 5 — Verification and documentation

- [ ] T014 Run relevant unit/contract tests, typecheck, and isolated desktop/browser smoke journeys.
  Confirm the existing editor undo, agent-turn checkpoint, archive, and sync-conflict journeys are
  unchanged. Record actual results; do not claim acceptance until they pass.
- [ ] T015 Update the public format, archive references, decision record, spec index, and changelog
  as required for the implemented storage choice. Keep chapter history described separately from
  editor undo, agent-turn checkpoints, whole-library archives, and sync conflicts.

## Dependency notes

### W02 bounded core evidence (2026-11-07)

- `history-restore.ts` plus narrow LibraryService/desktop facade integration implements restore,
  restore-specific undo and read-only reconciliation. No second queue/writer, automatic pruning,
  quota, deletion, draft flush, IPC or UI was added.
- Focused synthetic history/restore/library/identity/damaged-file regressions: **129 passed,
  0 failed, 832 assertions across eight files**. Includes two-writer conflicts, same-body stale
  checks, cancellation, history/chapter faults, uncertain readbacks, failed finalization, unknown
  metadata, reopen/undo, real filesystem archives carrying safety/intent through live/trash state,
  preservation of a racing desktop draft as a normal conflict copy, and quiet successful restore/
  undo despite unrelated malformed chapter candidates (no legacy catalog scan from history).
- Workspace desktop node/web, browser and toolkit typechecks passed. Strict standalone checking
  of new core/desktop tests and their imported closure passed. Focused lint has only the existing
  LibraryService watch non-null-assertion warning. Parent owns full verify/coverage/build/e2e and
  independent candidate review. T007–T009 and T014–T015 remain unticked.

### W02 isolated UI evidence (2026-11-07)

- `bun test apps/desktop/tests/chapter-history-ui.test.tsx apps/desktop/tests/dialog-focus.test.tsx`:
  **40 passed, 0 failed, 188 assertions** (36 new history UI cases and four shared focus regressions).
  Synthetic callbacks cover individual unavailable records, literal/Unicode bodies, source/draft
  disclosure, invalid labels, duplicate submission, uncertain capture review, read/compare failures,
  selection and source races, navigation ABA, close/reopen, unmount and focus return.
- Desktop `tsconfig.web.json` and `tsconfig.node.json` no-emit typechecks passed; focused Biome lint
  passed for the new leaf and test. Only the new test's desktop include/exclude entries were added.
- These are isolated component receipts, not IPC/host-gate, visual, browser or full application
  acceptance. T005/T006/T014 remain open; parent owns mounting and integrated gates. Restore/undo,
  retention cleanup and book-level size totals are not delivered by this UI leaf.

### W01 validation evidence (2026-11-07)

- Focused command: `bun test packages/core/tests/chapter-history.test.ts packages/core/tests/chapter-history-storage-premises.test.ts packages/core/tests/chapter-history-retention-premises.test.ts packages/core/tests/library-service.test.ts packages/core/tests/archive.test.ts apps/desktop/tests/chapter-history.test.ts apps/desktop/tests/library.test.ts`.
  Result: **82 passed, 0 failed, 445 assertions** across seven files, including the W15 follow-up
  for a commit that publishes successfully and then fails readback (retain the complete record,
  report uncertainty, no automatic retry).
- `bun run typecheck`: passed for desktop node/web, browser and toolkit. A strict standalone
  TypeScript check of the new core test also passed with desktop/root `@types` roots supplied,
  because that file is outside desktop's test include. Focused Biome lint: four new files clean.
- No full suite, hidden app, browser/device, real library, credential, live provider or release run
  is claimed. T014/T015 remain open for integrated acceptance and coordinator-owned public records.

### Coordinator codec/adapter follow-up (2026-11-07)

- Resolve W01's independent F1/F2 findings: history/source YAML parsing never emits source excerpts;
  book parser errors are safely summarized. The accepted plain-value metadata domain rejects
  unsupported tagged/reserved/cyclic/foreign values and lossy numbers before they can change type.
  Metadata is captured before asynchronous serialization; supported nested fields survive.
- Integrate the independently accepted static filesystem containment repair. Add metadata-only
  unsupported-entry inspection so a linked history record is listed unavailable without following
  it. Ordinary archive traversal keeps excluding links/special entries. No path-swap/CAS claim.
- **118 focused tests passed, 0 failed, 874 assertions across 11 files**: history codec/service,
  history storage/retention premises, real filesystem history and containment, port conformance,
  ordinary chapter identity/damaged-file handling, Library service and watcher/own-write behavior.
  Real history tests cover history-directory/chapter-directory/record links to outside, inside
  excluded storage and broken targets, plus byte-exact live/trash archive round-trips.
- All workspace typechecks passed; focused strict source/test typecheck passed. Focused lint has
  one existing Library-service non-null assertion warning. Both completion DAGs pass. A fresh
  combined-candidate review and integrated gates remain required; T014/T015 stay open.

- OQ-001 is resolved by D-175. T001's format/ADR follow-through and T003's schema still precede
  persistence; archive/trash tests accompany the first durable snapshot slice.
- OQ-002 is resolved by D-176. T011 implements that policy; all paths report storage failures
  without pruning existing data. The decision checkbox is not implementation acceptance.
- Every test fixture is synthetic and isolated. No task authorizes access to real manuscripts,
  credentials, live providers, paid services, or devices.
