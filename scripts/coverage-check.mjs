 * What is counted, and how it is averaged.
 *
 * Bun's "All files" line averages every file the run loaded, and not all of them are the
 * repository's. The plugin tests write TypeScript fixtures into temporary folders and load them,
 * so rows such as `$TMPDIR/studio-capabilities-<random>/demo.ts` join the table, most of them at 0%
 * of functions, and a different set on every run. They moved the summary with the fixtures, not
 * with the code.
 *
 * So the check reads bun's per-file rows, keeps the files inside the repository root and says how
 * many it left out. The average is the one bun's summary uses: the unweighted mean of the per-file
 * percentages, where every file counts once whatever its size. The floor is the same one. Leaving
 * the fixtures out does not lower the bar; it stops counting code that is not the repository's.
 *
 * The method is checked, not assumed: the mean of every row must match bun's own summary first, so
 * a bun that averages or prints differently fails the check instead of quietly moving the number.
