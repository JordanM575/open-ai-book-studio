/**
 * Every end-to-end check in one place.
 *
 * The unit tests cover the library in process. This runs the things that only fail when a real
 * app, a real browser and a real second process are involved, in the order a person would meet
 * them:
 *
 *   smoke       the built desktop app, driven through its own renderer
 *   web         the browser build, over its own storage
 *   audit       the real window at 1440x900, for dead ends and missing controls
 *   phone       the same window at 390x844, because the phone layout is a real surface
 *   glasses     the 600x600 page for Meta Ray-Ban Display, in a browser at that size
 *   ambient     the ambient agent over the control plane and the toolkit
 *   toolkit     the bookwriter CLI and MCP server against the running app, checked on disk
 *   agent       one real agent turn, against a fake provider on loopback (D-184)
 *   plugins     a folder of TypeScript tools, loaded by the built app
 *   bridge      the phone's half: a separate process speaking to the app over the LAN
 *   offline     writing through export with every outbound connection denied (macOS only)
 *   instance    a second copy on the same profile: refused, nothing written, the open copy says so
 *
 *   bun run e2e            build, then run everything
 *   bun run e2e --no-build trust the current build
 *   bun run e2e smoke web  run only the checks named
 *
 * A live check needs keys and costs money, so it is not here. `bun run live:check` is its own gate.
