/**
 * Proves that a second copy of the studio on the same profile is refused, and that the open copy
 * tells the author (spec 002 FR-069).
 *
 * Copy A is the built app, hidden, on a throwaway profile whose settings point at a synthetic
 * library. It runs the control plane with its locator in the temp folder (`STUDIO_BACKEND_FILE`)
 * rather than `~/.ai-book-studio`, and it opens the fixture book in its editor. Copy B is a second
 * launch with exactly A's environment: the same profile, the same library and the same locator path.
 * A copy that got past the single-instance lock would rewrite `studio.json`, rebuild the library
 * catalog, overwrite the locator and load a renderer, so each of those is checked.
 *
 * Hidden test runs claim the lock on their own `STUDIO_USER_DATA` profile, so B can only lose to A,
 * never to the author's real studio.
 *
 *   1. B exits on its own, with status 0, within the bound, and says why.
 *   2. B wrote nothing: against a snapshot taken once A's own writes have settled, every file in the
 *      library and the profile, and the locator, keeps its bytes, size, modification time and inode
 *      when B exits, and nothing was added or removed. Only A's GPU shader cache is left out.
 *   3. A shows the notice in its renderer, the notice can be dismissed, and A's one window stays hidden.
 *   4. A still writes: typing into the open chapter autosaves to disk afterwards.
 *   5. A copy on a different throwaway profile starts and opens its own library, and A hears nothing.
 *   6. With A's window closed, a refused copy makes A create its window again, still hidden, and the
 *      new window shows the notice. A blank window that is never shown keeps A running meanwhile,
 *      standing in for macOS, where the studio keeps running after its last window closes.
